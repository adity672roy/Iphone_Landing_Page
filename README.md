# iPhone Landing Page

I have created an **iPhone Landing Page** using modern frontend technologies to showcase the iPhone in an **interactive and visually appealing way**.

🔗 **Deployed Link:** [iPhone Landing Page](https://iphone-landing-page-roan.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **iPhone Landing Page** is a sleek, interactive, and fully responsive webpage that highlights the iPhone’s key features. It incorporates **3D visuals, smooth animations, and engaging transitions** to enhance the user experience and provide a premium feel.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### **Frontend**
- **React.js** – Used for building a modular and reusable component-based UI.
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** – A powerful library built on top of Three.js for rendering **real-time 3D models**, making the iPhone visualization immersive.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – Used for **smooth scrolling animations, transitions, and entrance effects**, ensuring a dynamic and visually engaging experience.

### **Styling**
- **Styled Components** – A CSS-in-JS solution for modular and scalable styling, keeping the codebase clean and manageable.

### **State & Animation Management**
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)** – Used to efficiently manage interactions and animations.
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger** – Implemented **scroll-based animations** for a more interactive experience.

### **Hosting & Deployment**
- **Vercel** – Deployed for fast, reliable hosting with automatic updates from GitHub, ensuring quick access and smooth performance.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

✅ **Smooth Animations & Transitions**: Leveraged **GSAP and React Three Fiber** for immersive visual effects.

✅ **Responsive & Mobile-Friendly**: Ensured **seamless experience across different screen sizes** using media queries.

✅ **3D Model Optimization**: Used **GLTF optimization** to reduce model size without losing quality, ensuring smooth performance.

✅ **Handling Heavy Animations**: Used **GSAP’s optimized rendering techniques** to ensure animations run smoothly without affecting page performance.

✅ **Scroll-Based Animations & Triggers**: Implemented **GSAP ScrollTrigger** to synchronize animations with scrolling behavior, providing an immersive browsing experience.

✅ **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured consistent performance and appearance across **Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge**.

## 🔥 Challenges & Solutions

🚀 **Ensuring Smooth Scrolling Animations**
- Utilized **GSAP ScrollTrigger** for animations.

🚀 **Performance Optimization**
- **Code splitting** to reduce initial load times.
- **Minimized re-renders** by optimizing state management.
